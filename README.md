# Python_3_Programs
Programs created in Python 3 programming language. 

Program ideas are generated from different sources. I have built this repository to build on my programming skills. 
The concept of the programs do not belong to me but, The source code is entirely mine from which the programs were build upon.
I will attempt to only implement orginal code but if i get stuck i will review program code in order better understand the mechanism 
of the program in which case i may recycle code from orginal source, and will be noted at the top. 
The purpose is to showcase my proficiency and improvement over time. 

  Thank you for reading.
